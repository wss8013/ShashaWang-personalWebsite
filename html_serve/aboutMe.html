        My name is Shasha Wang. I am currently pursuing Master's degree in computer science at Northeastern
        University. An enthusiastic learner who's always striving for professional development.
        I'm currently looking for internship opportunities for Summer '23 to help me grow in the field to
        gain some mentorship from professionals in the field, and let me put all my skills to some good use. I would
        love to be a part of a work environment that promotes mentorship and a good work-life balance.
        My further goal is to become work as a full time software engineer and build the future of the world
        using my engineering skill.

        I received my previous master degree in Professional Accounting at Macquarie University in Australia. As an
        accountant, I started using an online software that helps people do their taxes and I have also
        used it for a few years to file our family tax returns. I was surprised by how amazing the job was done by the
        software. It takes much less time than a real CPA and does it far more accurately. I was amazed by how computer
        software can help people live a much simpler life. The potential of computing is endless. So I decided to pursue
        a
        degree in Computer Science and try to do some impactful work to help people around the world.My goal is to
        complete my master degree in computer science, gain the essential skills and find an opportunity to pursue a
        career as a software engineer.
